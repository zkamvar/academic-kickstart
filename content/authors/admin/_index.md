I'm a research software engineer currently working in the field of outbreak
response analytics. I'm trained in the [population genetics of clonal plant
pathogens](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr) and have a strong passion for
creating user-friendly and sensible computational tools in R. 

This site serves as my personal site where I can blog about various subjects
including R programming, reproducible science, and population genetics.
